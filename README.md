A grid turn-based RPG built in C++ as a console app.

Can be built as is.

This is a work in progress, with core combat functionality, spells, movement, and random map generator being built.
Currently only the in-combat part of the game is designed (apart from the map being randomly generated - which needs design elements added. This will be achieved using randomly generated pre-built segments, random segments, and random 'tiles')
Item generator is inspired by Diablo I & Diablo II and is not yet completed.

Features to come:  
  • <b> 5-tier Item Generator </b>  
    • Each weapon type has specific passive procs  
    • Each armor has specific character upgrades (like spell slots, passive slots, consumable slots, etc...)  
    • Item Levels go from 3 to 1000+ with intention of endless gameplay (there are quite a few calculations to be done to achieve this)  
  • <b> World-Map Design </b>
