A grid turn-based RPG built in C++ as a console app.

Can be built as is.

This is a work in progress, with core combat functionality, spells, movement, and random map generator being built.
Currently only the in-combat part of the game is designed (apart from the map being randomly generated - which needs design elements added. This will be achieved using randomly generated pre-built segments, random segments, and random 'tiles')
Item generator is inspired by Diablo I & Diablo II and is not yet completed.

The game is intended to be endless, very difficult, and hardcore mode is assumed.

The current state of the game is for testing purposes only.  
Several features have been disabled or hard-coded for testing purposes.  

Features to come:  
    • <b> 5-tier Item Generator </b>  
        • Each weapon type has specific passive procs  
        • Each armor has specific character upgrades (like spell slots, passive slots, consumable slots, etc...)  
        • Item Levels go from 3 to 1000+ with intention of endless, yet ever-evolving gameplay (there are quite a few calculations to be done to achieve this)  
        • Sockets
        • Unique-only spells & passives
    • <b> World-Map Design & Improved Procedural Generation </b>  
        • Enemies grow in strength with time (like in Heroes of Might and Magic)  
        • Bosses spawn on random high-tier segments which guard item chests or spells / spellbooks  
        • NPC aggro range  
    • <b> Challenging AI </b>  
        • Deep behaviour tree-like decision making (this would also be affected by certain affixes, attributes, time, etc...)
        • State-context for predicting player decisions based on gameplay statistics  
    • <b> Talents, Spells, Spellbooks, Passives </b>  
        • Dual-class talent trees  
        • Spell crafting (with goal of eventually reaching several thousands of combinations)  
        • Spellbook system where you have to pre-equip spells that can be only used with specific spellbooks 
        • Hundreds of Active & Passive spells - core functionallity has been written, allowing for robust and creative passive abilities  
        • Class-specific passives & resources  

...And much, much more.

Development has been temporarily halted due to me working on a wine-tracking, selling & delivery system for my family business.  

This is just the begining and this project is to be revisited soon and is expected to be completed by Q2 2026.  
After that - feel free to fork the project, but you <b>can not use it commercially and have to credit the source.</b>  

There is a slight possibility that the project will be ported to Unreal Engine (with pristine graphics), if enough interest arises and my obligations allow for it.
