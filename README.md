<h1>CARTAGRA ©</h1>

A grid turn-based RPG built in C++ as a console app.

Can be built as is.

This is a work in progress, with core combat functionality, spells, movement, and random map generator being built.  
Currently only the in-combat part of the game is designed (apart from the map being randomly generated - which needs design elements added. This will be achieved using randomly generated pre-built segments, random segments, and random 'tiles').  
Item generator is inspired by Diablo I & Diablo II and is not yet completed.

The game is intended to be endless, very difficult, and hardcore mode is assumed.

<hr/>

-> The current state of the game is for testing purposes only.  
-> Several features have been disabled or hard-coded for testing purposes.

<hr/>
Development has been temporarily halted due to me working on a wine-tracking, selling & delivery system for my family business.  

This is just the begining and this project is to be revisited soon and is expected to be completed by Q2 2026.  
After that - feel free to fork the project, but you <b>can not use it commercially and have to credit the source.</b>  
Project codename: <b>CARTAGRA ©<b/>

There is a slight possibility that the project will be ported to Unreal Engine (with pristine graphics), if enough interest arises and my obligations allow for it.
